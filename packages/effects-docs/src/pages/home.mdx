## What is it?

Extensions to the javascript language, enabling new control flows that
may be well suited to a variety of general purpose programming contexts.

## Example

```ts
async function main() {
  "use effects"; // highlight-line
  try {
    const cat = await getCatUrl();
    console.log(cat)
  } handle "fetchJson" with ({ data }) {  // highlight-line
    recall await fetch(data.url).then(res => res.json())  // highlight-line
  }
}
async function getCatUrl() {
  const metaCat = perform {  // highlight-line
    type: "fetchJson", // highlight-line
    data: { url: "https://aws.random.cat/meow" }
  };
  return metaCat.file
}
main()
```

## TL;DR - What are Algebraic Effects?

The best way to conceptualize the effect control flow is to expand upon an already well-known programming language construct, `Exception`s.

Consider the following example:

```javascript
const child = () => {
  throw "Hello";
};

const parent = () => {
  child();
  doMoreWork();
};

const main = () => {
  try {
    parent();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
};
```

Function calls get pushed onto the call-stack as they are invoked.
Normally, after a function completes, its frame is popped off of the call stack
and the previous stack frame is resumed. The above example demonstrates an
alternative flow:

- `child` throws an exception,
- the exception "bubbles" up the call-stack until a call-site with an exception handler is found.

If you've been programming in a language that offers first-class support for exception handling as outlined above, you're most-likely
comfortable with the flow just described.

Now let's tweak our existing mental model for this new concept. Imagine a catch-block that can resume back to the throwing call-site.
In the above example, our `catch` block in `main`, would recall to `child`.

This is the crash course for the proposed control flow, and the keywords to facilitate it.

## Keywords

| Keyword   | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `perform` | Initiates an effect. The current function halts, and later resumes when an effect handler `resume`s                                                                   |
| `handle`  | `try/handle` blocks allow users to specify handlers for effect events, using well-known `try/catch`-like semantics. `try/handle` is _not_ compatible with `try/catch` |
| `recall`  | Recalls the previously halted function, who called `perform`.                                                                                                         |

<div className="node funsies" children={<Logo />} />

## Getting started

There are two ways to get started:

- [Try our editor and examples online, now!](./examples)
- [(pending) Install effects into your javascript or typescript project](./installation)

<div className="node funsies" children={<Logo />} />
